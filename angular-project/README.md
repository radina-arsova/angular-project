# YouForOthers - Angular - Project

YouForOthers web application has two levels of access to its content: registered user and guest user roles are implemented.
After registration and subsequent successful Login to the system, a registered user is authorized to access causes or events related information. He may also apply for an event of his choice or donate money from his bank account for any of the causes. The registered user can also create causes or events that he can edit or delete later.

Registered user could edit his account information at any time. If the customer decides that YouForOthers services are no longer required, the user profile could be permanently deleted on demand. The registered user is permitted to view the following sections:

"Causes" -> "Donate" / "Details“; (or if the author of the cause is he "Causes"->"Edit" / "Delete"); "Causes"->"Create your own cause"

"Events" -> "I will come" / "Details“; (or if the author of the cause is he "Events"->"Edit"/"Delete"); "Events"->"Create your own event"

"User Profile" -> "Edit Profile" / "Delete Profile" / "Add to your bank balance"

The guest user has access to general information about the company and can see lists of all causes and events. The following pages are public and visible to any visitor on YouForOthers charity site: "Our causes", "Events", "About us", "Register" and „Login".
The application is built entirely on latest JavaScript technologies: React.js (client side) and node.js (server side).
